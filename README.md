# Scrapbook: online art community

Scrapbook is a web application developed for amateur artists. It is an online art community that provides the users the means to share art content, create personalised profiles and discover other artists. 

Sharing art content in Scrapbook is done by creating, browsing and viewing artwork posts. An optional feedback section can be turned on for any artwork post where other members can give suggestions or critique to the artwork. Members of the community can create art tutorials attaching image and video files.
